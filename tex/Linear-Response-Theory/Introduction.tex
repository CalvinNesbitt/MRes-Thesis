% Linear Response Theory Chapter Introduction

Linear response theory allows us to determine how a linear system responds to a external forcing. Moreover, by studying the system's response to different kinds of perturbations we can gain insight to the systems behaviour. For example, we may want to know how a damped oscillator responds to a perturbation, or more practically how the climate responds to changes in temperature gradient. Here we outline the theory of classical linear response. First we introduce response functions $\chi$ and show how, via the convolution integral, they allow us to find the linear response of a system. We will then talk about important properties of $\chi$ in particular the Kramers-Kronig relations. Finally we mention the fluctuation dissipation theorem that allows us to use statistics to find $\chi$.
