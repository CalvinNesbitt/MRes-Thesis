\section{A Review of Previous Results}

\subsection{Sarno and Lucarini 2011}

In their 2011 paper \cite{Lucarini2011}, Lucarini and Sarno successfully applied Ruelle's linear response theory to the Lorenz 96 model. The L96 model is a simplified model of the atmosphere on a latitudinal ring. Although simple, L96 has dynamics that incorporate the key physical processes in the atmosphere: dissipation, advection and an external forcing: 

\begin{align}
\dv{x_i}{t} = x_{i-1} \left( x_{i+1} - x_{i-2} \right) - x_i + F.
\end{align} 

\noindent In the above, $x_i$ are the grid points on the latitudinal ring. The quadratic term represents advection, the $x_i$ term thermal/mechanical damping and $F$ the external forcing.
