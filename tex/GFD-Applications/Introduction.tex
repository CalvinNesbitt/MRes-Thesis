So far, we have discussed the theory of linear response in the abstract. Now the time has come to focus on it's applicability in geophysical fluid dynamics. We shall begin by discussing previous results where response theory has been used successfully in climate modelling. We shall then introduce the MAOOAM model and outline the experiments we intend to perform with it to test the ideas of linear response.
