\section{Magnets \& Butterflies} \label{Section: Ruelle}

Ruelle has shown that for uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems, the linear response far from equilibrium is similar to the linear response close to equilibrium \cite{Ruelle}. Before we present these results we will first discuss the concept of an SRB measure.

\subsection{Symbolic Dynamics \& SRB Measures}

During the second half of the twentieth century it became apparent that a raft of formal tools developed during the $1960$s for understanding phase transitions in magnetic lattices were useful to the study of chaotic dynamical systems \cite{Baladi2000}. In particular, in contrast to the difficulty of understanding particular trajectories, it was shown that chaotic dynamical systems admit a good statistical description of their asymptotic behaviour. Specifically, the work of Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen during the $70$s showed the long time equivalence of time and spatial averages for Axiom A systems \cite{Bowen1970} \cite{Sinai1972} \cite{Bowen1975} \cite{Ruelle1976}. Following \cite{Eckmann1985} we shall refer to this equivalence as the \textbf{Natural Measure Property}:

\begin{align} \label{Natural Property}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \phi(f^k(x)) = \int_{\Omega} \phi(y) \dd \mu(y) 
\end{align}

\noindent The proofs of the above results were obtained by translating results of Thermodynamic Formalism \cite{Ruelle2004} to that of hyperbolic dynamics via techniques of symbolic dynamics, specifically that of Markov Partitions \& sub-shifts of finite type. \\

\noindent Since the proof of the above results are not the subject of this thesis we point the interested reader to the afore cited papers for details as well as \cite{Walters1982}. We do however wish to highlight a few informal points that will help explain later exposition. Firstly, the proof that the Natural Measure Property \ref{Natural Property} holds for a measure $\mu$ of  an Axiom A systems relies on two conditions along the unstable direction of the hyperbolic dynamics: ergodicity and absolute continuity of $\mu$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. The second of these conditions is often referred to as the \textbf{SRB property} and is used to define SRB measures.

\subsection{Linear response: The Uniformly Hyperbolic Case}



As in chapter \ref{Chapter: LRT} we are interested in finding the response function $\chi$ that gives the linear response $\delta_t\rho (A)$ of an observable $A$ to a perturbation of the form $X(x)\phi(t)$:

\begin{align} \label{basic response}
\delta_t \rho(A) = \int \dd t' \chi(t - t') \phi (t')
\end{align}

\noindent Following Ruelle \cite{Ruelle} we will derive the linear response $\delta \rho$ for the general case where $\rho$ is an SRB measure and $f$ is a diffeomorphism of $M$. For such a measure we have:

\begin{align}
\rho(A) &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1} ^n \int l( \dd x) A (f^k x)\\
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1} ^n \int (f^{k*}l)( \dd x) A (x)
\end{align}

\noindent Now we consider the perturbed dynamics $\tilde{f} x = f x + X(fx)$, which we linearise as:

\begin{align}
\tilde{f}^kx = f^k x + \sum_{j = 1}^k \left(T_{f^j x} f^{k - j} \right) X(f^j x).
\end{align}

\noindent The value of our observable is then:

\begin{align}
A(\tilde{f}^k x) &= A(f^k x) + A'(f^k x) \sum_{j = 1}^k \left(T_{f^j x} f^{k - j} \right) X(f^j x)\\
&= A(f^k x) + \sum_{j=1} ^k X(f^j x) \grad_{f^j x} \left(A \circ f ^{k -j} \right).
\end{align}

\noindent From here we can then calculate the response as:

\begin{align}
\delta \rho (A) &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k \int l (\dd x) X(f^j x) \grad_{f^j x} \left(A \circ f ^{k -j} \right)\\
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k \int (f^{j*} l (\dd x )) X(x) \grad_{x} \left(A \circ f ^{k -j} \right)\\ 
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \geq 0} \sum_{j=1}^{n-i} \int (f^{j*} l (\dd x )) X(x) \grad_{x} \left(A \circ f ^i \right)
\end{align}

\noindent Using $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n-i} f^{j*} l = \rho$ we then arrive at:

\begin{align}
\delta \rho (A) = \sum_{n =0}^\infty \int \rho (\dd x) X(f^{-n}x) \grad_{f^{-n}x}\left(A \circ f^n \right) \label{response}
\end{align}

\noindent We note the fact the sum in \ref{response} extends over $n \geq 0$ can be physically interpreted as causality \cite{Ruelle}. In particular the response of $\rho(A)$ to the perturbation $X$ is the sum of the $n$ terms corresponding to the response at previous times. Looking at the fourier transform of \ref{response} we also obtain an expression for the susceptibility:

\begin{align}
\Psi(\lambda) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda ^n \int \rho (\dd x) X(x) \grad_x \left(A \circ f^n \right)
\end{align}

\noindent where we have written $\lambda = e^{in\omega}$. The key result shown by Ruelle is that in the uniformly hyperbolic case if $X^s$ and $X^u$ are the components of $X$ in  the stable and unstable directions one can write:

\begin{align} \label{Response Geometry}
\Psi(\lambda) = \Psi ^s(\lambda) + \Psi ^u (\lambda)
\end{align}

\noindent where:

\begin{align}
\Psi^s(\lambda) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda^n \int \rho(\dd x) \left( \left(T_x f^n \right) X^s \right) \grad_{f^n x} A \\
\Psi^u(\lambda) &= - \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda^n \int \rho(\dd x) \left( \divtext_x^u X^u \right) A(f^n x)
\end{align}

\noindent The above is proven in \cite{Ruelle1997}. Note that the $\Psi^u$ term is given by a correlation function. Physically we interpret this as the natural fluctuations in the unstable directions of the dynamics. Thus, in the non-equilibrium case, we note the non-equivalence of free and forced fluctuations gives an alternative version of the fluctuation dissipation theorem where these fluctuations are traditionally equivalent.
