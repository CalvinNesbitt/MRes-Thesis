\section{Ruelle's Response}
Ruelle has shown that for uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems, the linear response far from equilibrium is similar to the linear response close to equilibrium \cite{Ruelle}. Before we present these results we will first discuss the concept of an SRB measure.

\subsection{Linear response: the uniformly hyperbolic case}

As in chapter \ref{Chapter: LRT} we are interested in finding the response function $\chi$ that gives the linear response $\delta_t\rho (A)$ of an observable $A$ to a perturbation of the form $X(x)\phi(t)$:

\begin{align}
\delta_t \rho(A) = \int \dd t' \chi(t - t') \phi (t')
\end{align}

\noindent We will derive the basic result for the case of discrete dynamics $f$.
